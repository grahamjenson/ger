Please refer to\nthe [official driver's documentation](http://www.rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/)\nfor all the ReQL methods (the methods used to build the query).\n\n\nThe main differences are:\n\n- You need to execute the module when you import it:\n\n```js\nvar r = require('rethinkdbdash')();\n// With the official driver:\n// var r = require('rethinkdb');\n```\n\n- Connections are managed by the driver with an efficient connection pool.\nOnce you have imported the driver, you can immediately run queries,\nyou don't need to call `r.connect`, or pass a connection to `run`.\n\n```js\nvar r = require('rethinkdbdash')();\nr.table('users').get('orphee@gmail.com').run().then(function(user) {\n  // ...\n}).error(handleError)\n```\n\n- Cursors are coerced to arrays by default\n\n```js\nvar r = require('rethinkdbdash')();\nr.table('data').run().then(function(result) {\n  assert(Array.isArray(result)) // true\n  // With the official driver you need to call\n  // result.toArray().then(function(result2) {\n  //   assert(Array.isArray(result2))\n  // })\n});\n```\n\n#### Drop in\n\nYou can replace the official driver with rethinkdbdash by just replacing\n\n```js\nvar r = require('rethinkdb');\n```\n\nWith:\n\n```js\nvar r = require('rethinkdbdash')({\n  pool: false,\n  cursor: true\n});\n```\n\nIf you want to take advantage of the connection pool, refer to the next section.\n\n\n#### From the official driver\n\nTo switch from the official driver to rethinkdbdash and get the most of it,\nhere are the few things to do:\n\n1. Change the way to import the driver.\n\n  ```js\n  var r = require('rethinkdb');\n  ```\n\n  To:\n\n  ```js\n  var r = require('rethinkdbdash')();\n  // Or if you do not connect to the default local instance:\n  // var r = require('rethinkdbdash')(servers: [{host: ..., port: ...}]);\n  ```\n\n2. Remove everything related to a connection:\n\n  ```js\n  r.connect({host: ..., port: ...}).then(function(connection) {\n    connection.on('error', handleError);\n    query.run(connection).then(function(result) {\n      // console.log(result);\n      connection.close();\n    });\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Becomes:\n\n  ```js\n  query.run().then(function(result) {\n    // console.log(result);\n  });\n  ```\n\n3. Remove the methods related to the cursor. This typically involves\nremoving `toArray`:\n\n  ```js\n  r.table('data').run(connection).then(function(cursor) {\n    cursor.toArray().then(function(result) {\n      // console.log(result):\n    });\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Becomes\n\n  ```js\n  r.table('data').run().then(function(result) {\n    // console.log(result);\n  });\n  ```\n\n\n\n### New features and differences\n\nRethinkdbdash ships with a few interesting features.\n\n\n#### Importing the driver\n\nWhen you import the driver, as soon as you execute the module, you will create\na default connection pool (except if you pass `{pool: false}`. The options you\ncan pass are:\n\n- `discovery`: `<boolean>` - When true, the driver will regularly pull data from the table `server_status` to\nkeep a list of updated hosts, default `true`\n- `pool`: `<boolean>` - Set it to `false`, if you do not want to use a connection pool.\n- `buffer`: `<number>` - Minimum number of connections available in the pool, default `50`\n- `max`: ``<number>` - Maximum number of connections available in the pool, default `1000`\n- `timeout`: `<number> - The number of seconds for a connection to be opened, default `20`\n- `timeoutError`: `<number> - Wait time before reconnecting in case of an error (in ms), default 1000\n- `imeoutGb`: `<number>` - How long the pool keep a connection that hasn't been used (in ms), default 60*60*1000\n- `maxExponent`: `<number>` - The maximum timeout before trying to reconnect is 2^maxExponent x timeoutError, default 6 (~60 seconds for the longest wait)\n- `silent`: <boolean> - console.error errors, default `false`\n- `servers`: an of objects `{host: <string>, port: <number>}` representing instances of\nRethinkDB to connect to.\n\nIn case of a single instance, you can directly pass `host` and `port` in the top level parameters.\n\nExamples:\n```\n// connect to localhost:8080, and let the driver find other instances\nvar r = require('rethinkdbdash')();\n\n// connect to and only to localhost:8080\nvar r = require('rethinkdbdash')({\n    discovery: false\n});\n\n// Do not create a connection pool\nvar r = require('rethinkdbdash')({pool: false});\n\n// Connect to a cluster seeding from `192.168.0.100`, `192.168.0.100`, `192.168.0.102`\nvar r = require('rethinkdbdash')({\n    servers: [\n        {host: '192.168.0.100', port: 28015},\n        {host: '192.168.0.101', port: 28015},\n        {host: '192.168.0.102', port: 28015},\n    ]\n});\n\n// Connect to a cluster containing `192.168.0.100`, `192.168.0.100`, `192.168.0.102` and\nuse a maximum of 3000 connections and try to keep 300 connections available at all time.\nvar r = require('rethinkdbdash')({\n    servers: [\n        {host: '192.168.0.100', port: 28015},\n        {host: '192.168.0.101', port: 28015},\n        {host: '192.168.0.102', port: 28015},\n    ],\n    buffer: 300,\n    max: 3000\n});\n```\n\nYou can also pass `{cursor: true}` if you want to retrieve RethinkDB streams as cursors\nand not arrays by default.\n\n_Note_: The option `{stream: true}` that asynchronously returns a stream is deprecated. Use `toStream` instead.\n\n#### Connection pool\n\nAs mentionned before, `rethinkdbdash` has a connection pool and manage all the connections\nitself. The connection pool is initialized as soon as you execute the module.\n\nYou should never have to worry about connections in rethinkdbdash. Connections are created\nas they are needed, and in case of a host failure, the pool will try to open connections with an\nexponential back off algorithm.\n\nThe driver execute one query per connection. Now that [rethinkdb/rethinkdb#3296](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/3296)\nis solved, this behavior may be changed in the future.\n\nBecause the connection pool will keep some connections available, a script will not\nterminate. If you have finished executing your queries and want your Node.js script\nto exit, you need to drain the pool with:\n\n```js\nr.getPoolMaster().drain();\n```\n\n##### Advanced details about the pool\n\nThe pool is composed of a `PoolMaster` that retrieve connections for `n` pools where `n` is the number of\nservers the driver is connected to. Each pool is connected to a unique host.\n\nTo access the pool master, you can call the method `r.getPoolMaster()`.\n\nThe pool emits a few events:\n- `draining`: when `drain` is called\n- `queueing`: when a query is added/removed from the queue (queries waiting for a connection), the size of the queue is provided\n- `size`: when the number of connections changes, the number of connections is provided\n- `available-size`: when the number of available connections changes, the number of available connections is provided\n\nYou can get the number of connections (opened or being opened).\n```js\nr.getPoolMaster().getLength();\n```\n\nYou can also get the number of available connections (idle connections, without\na query running on it).\n\n```js\nr.getPoolMaster().getAvailableLength();\n```\n\nYou can also drain the pool as mentionned earlier with;\n\n```js\nr.getPoolMaster().drain();\n```\n\nYou can access all the pools with:\n```js\nr.getPoolMaster().getPools();\n```\n\n##### Note about connections\n\nIf you do not wish to use rethinkdbdash connection pool, you can implement yours. The\nconnections created with rethinkdbdash emits a \"release\" event when they receive an\nerror, an atom, or the end (or full) sequence.\n\nA connection can also emit a \"timeout\" event if the underlying connection times out.\n\n\n#### Arrays by default, not cursors\n\nRethinkdbdash automatically coerce cursors to arrays. If you need a raw cursor,\nyou can call the `run` command with the option `{cursor: true}` or import the\ndriver with `{cursor: true}`.\n\n```js\nr.expr([1, 2, 3]).run().then(function(result) {\n  console.log(JSON.stringify(result)) // print [1, 2, 3]\n})\n```\n\n```js\nr.expr([1, 2, 3]).run({cursor: true}).then(function(result) {\n  cursor.toArray().then(function(result) {\n    console.log(JSON.stringify(result)) // print [1, 2, 3]\n  });\n})\n```\n\n__Note__: If a query returns a cursor, the connection will not be\nreleased as long as the cursor hasn't fetched everything or has been closed.\n\n\n#### Readable streams\n\n[Readable streams](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable) can be\nsynchronously returned with the `toStream([connection])` method.\n\n```js\nvar fs = require('fs');\nvar file = fs.createWriteStream('file.txt');\n\nvar r = require('rethinkdbdash')();\nr.table('users').toStream()\n  .on('error', console.log)\n  .pipe(file)\n  .on('error', console.log)\n  .on('end', function() {\n    r.getPool().drain();\n  });\n```\n\n_Note:_ The stream will emit an error if you provide it with a single value (streams, arrays\nand grouped data work fine).\n\n_Note:_ `null` values are currently dropped from streams.\n\n#### Writable and Transform streams\n\nYou can create a [Writable](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_writable)\nor [Transform](http://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_transform) streams by\ncalling `toStream([connection, ]{writable: true})` or\n`toStream([connection, ]{transform: true})` on a table.\n\nThis makes a convenient way to dump a file your database.\n\n```js\nvar file = fs.createReadStream('users.json')\nvar table = r.table('users').toStream({writable: true});\n\nfile.pipe(transformer) // transformer would be a Transform stream that splits per line and call JSON.parse\n    .pipe(table)\n    .on('finish', function() {\n        console.log('Done');\n        r.getPool().drain();\n    });\n```\n\n\n#### Optional `run` with `yield`\n\nThe `then` and `catch` methods are implemented on a `Term` - returned by any methods\nlike `filter`, `update` etc. They are shortcut for `this.run().then(callback)` and\n`this.run().catch(callback)`.\n\nThis means that you can `yield` any query without calling `run.`\n\n```js\nvar bluebird = require('bluebird');\nvar r = require('rethinkdbdash')();\n\nbluebird.coroutine(function*() {\n  try {\n    var result = yield r.table('users').get('orphee@gmail.com').update({name: 'Michel'});\n    assert.equal(result.errors, 0);\n  } catch(err) {\n    console.log(err);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n_Note_: You have to start Node >= 0.11 with the `--harmony` flag.\n\n\n#### Global default values\n\nYou can set the maximum nesting level and maximum array length on all your queries with:\n\n```js\nr.setNestingLevel(<number>)\n```\n\n```js\nr.setArrayLimit(<number>)\n```\n\n#### Undefined values\n\nRethinkdbdash will ignore the keys/values where the value is `undefined` instead\nof throwing an error like the official driver.\n\n\n#### Better errors\n\n\n##### Backtraces\n\nIf your query fails, the driver will return an error with a backtrace; your query\nwill be printed and the broken part will be highlighted.\n\nBacktraces in rethinkdbdash are tested and properly formatted. Typically, long backtraces\nare split on multiple lines and if the driver cannot serialize the query,\nit will provide a better location of the error.\n\n\n##### Arity errors\n\nThe server may return confusing error messages when the wrong number\nof arguments is provided (See [rethinkdb/rethinkdb#2463](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2463) to track progress).\nRethinkdbdash tries to make up for it by catching errors before sending\nthe query to the server if possible.\n\n\n#### Performance\n\nThe tree representation of the query is built step by step and stored which avoid\nrecomputing it if the query is re-run.  \n\nThe code was partially optimized for v8, and is written in pure JavaScript which avoids\nerrors like [issue #2839](https://github.com/rethinkdb/rethinkdb/issues/2839)\n\n\n### Run tests\n\nUpdate `test/config.js` if your RethinkDB instance doesn't run on the default parameters.\n\nMake sure you run a version of Node that supports generators and run:\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\n\nTests are also being run on [wercker](http://wercker.com/):\n- Builds: [https://app.wercker.com/#applications/52dffe8ba4acb3ef16010ef8/tab](https://app.wercker.com/#applications/52dffe8ba4acb3ef16010ef8/tab)\n- Box: \n  - Github: [https://github.com/neumino/box-rethinkdbdash](https://github.com/neumino/box-rethinkdbdash)\n  - Wercker builds: [https://app.wercker.com/#applications/52dffc65a4acb3ef16010b60/tab](https://app.wercker.com/#applications/52dffc65a4acb3ef16010b60/tab)\n\n\n### FAQ\n\n- __Why rethinkdbdash?__\n\n  Rethinkdbdash was built as an experiment for promises and a connection pool. Its\n  purpose was to test new features and improve the official driver. Today,\n  rethinkdbdash still tries to make the developer experience as pleasant as possible -\n  like with the recent support for Node.js streams.\n\n  Some features like promises have been back ported to the official driver, some like\n  the connection pool and streams are on their way.\n\n\n- __Is it stable?__\n\n  Yes. Rethinkdbdash is used by quite many people. The driver is also used by `thinky`,\n  and has been and is still being tested in the wild.\n\n\n- __Does it work with io.js?__\n\n  All the tests pass with io.js so yes.\n\n\n- __Is rethinkdbdash going to become the JavaScript official driver?__\n\n  Not (yet?), maybe :)\n\n  Completely replacing the driver requires some work:\n  - Integrate the driver in RethinkDB suite test.\n  - Support HTTP connections.\n  - Rollback some default like the coercion of cursors to arrays.\n\n\n- __Can I contribute?__\n\n  Because I would like to give rethinkdbdash to RethinkDB, I would like to\n  keep ownership of the code (mostly because I don't like dealing with legal stuff).\n  So I would rather not merge pull requests. That being said, feedback,\n  bug reports etc. are welcome!\n\n  If you want to write code, come help with [thinky](https://github.com/neumino/thinky)!\n",
